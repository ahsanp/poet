Project Description
----------------------------------------
The Performance with Optimal Energy Toolkit (POET) provides a means to monitor
and adjust application performance while minimizing energy consumption during
application runtime.

For details, please see the following and reference as appropriate:

Running POET Examples
----------------------------------------

Build the library and test binaries:

$ mkdir _build
$ cd _build
$ cmake ..
$ make

For some tests, you need the heartbeats-simple and energymon libraries
installed.

Run the tests:

$ ./[test_binary] [num_beats] [target_rate] [window_size]

The num_beats is the number of total heartbeats the application will cycle
through before exiting. The target_rate is the number of heartbeats per second,
and the window size is the number of heartbeats used to calculate the heartbeat
rate. It doesn't make sense to give the test binary a target heartbeat rate
without knowing the normal heartbeat rate of the application on your system. To
find this, run:

$ ./[test_binary] [num_beats] 0 [window_size]

If you aren't sure what parameters to use, a good place to start is 200 beats
and a window size of 20.


Installing/Uninstalling POET
----------------------------------------
To install POET to the local system, run:

$ make install

Headers are installed to /usr/local/include/poet.
The library is installed to /usr/local/lib.

To uninstall POET, run:

$ make uninstall
